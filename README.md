# VEX-VR5-Text
Note: The actual Code is in FolderName/src/main.cpp but all the folder and files are needed to run it

For a better understanding, download the code and open it in VEXCode IDE, as it is easier due to the IDE changes the color of keywords and reserved words (You will need to download the whole folder OR create a New VEX Project and copy the Code from main.cpp which I recommend)
